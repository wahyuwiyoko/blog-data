Hi!

My name is Wahyu Wiyoko. I'm a software engineering expertise student.
To know more about me, visit my [portfolio website](https://wahyuwiyoko.github.io/).

I made this blog for documentation and some notes, so that I don't forget one day :D

Usually, I'll note a system configuration of a software or about other things and will be posted on this blog.

I use [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) as a SSG (Static Site Generator) and [PaperMod](https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod/) theme on this blog.
Thanks to [Aditya Telange](https://github.com/adityatelange) for creating this simple theme for the blog.

That's all. Thanks for visiting my blog :)
